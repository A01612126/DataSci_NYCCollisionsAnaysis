# DataSci_NYCCollisionsAnaysis
In this python data science project, i took data from the website of NYC about motor vehicle collisions, analyzed it and showing the results in an informative, easy to digest way using dynamic charts and maps from streamlit and PyDeck. 

This is my first outside-of-school project. I was looking to do a data science project (since it is my favorite area of CS) that wouldn't take much time to complete and could look good as a final product. 

About the code... first we imported all the libraries that we used throughout the project such as streamlit, pandas, numpy, PyDeck and plotly express. Streamlit allows us to create great-looking web apps without having to worry much about knowing web development concepts. Pandas was used for filtering the data, numpy and plotly express was used for the histogram below the 3D map and PyDeck was crucial for having our beautiful 3D map mentioned before.

The data I used was obtained from the official NYC data website: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Person/f55k-p6yu/about_data

I think that these kinds of projects are very useful for testing our analysis and coding skills as beginner/intermediate programmers and could be useful for advanced programmers too to reinforce already known concepts. 
In my opinion, data science is the most relevant area of CS since virtually all important decisions that have to be made in today's world are (or at least must be) based on data and if we understand how to work with it and communicate it seamlessly, we'll be closer to solving our problems as a society.
